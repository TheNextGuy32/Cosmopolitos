Play the demos @ http://cosmopolitos.com/ and http://oliverbarnum.com/projects/culture.html

Cosmopolitos is an abstraction of cultural differences that simulates interaction between diverse peoples.
Each 2D colored sphere and 3d colored peg is a person, its color denotes its "cultural position" relative to others. 
Size represents the worldliness of that person, how able he or she is to communicate with people foreign to him or her.

The closer two spheres are the more alike they are culturally.
                
# Rules of Interaction:
-----------------------
People who are just foreign enough have an eye opening experience and draw closer to the center.
People who are too alike isolate themselves by moving away from the center.
People who are too foreign lose worldliness and isolate themselves.
                        
# Libraries
-----------
Cosmopolitos uses 3JS and HTML5 Canvas to render graphs and geometry. 
Use the WASD keys to move the camera within the 3D scene.

To view the project, open JS/index.html within the
web browser of your choice.

To run the Python MatPlotLib version, cd to the Python directory using 
the Anaconda command prompt and use the command 'python abc.py'

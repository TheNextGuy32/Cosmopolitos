# Cosmopolitos
--------------

Cosmopolitos was first developed in MatPlotLib in Python, later it was 
redone in 3JS and HTML5 Canvas. Both versions are fully operation. 
To run the Python version, open Python/abc.py within Anaconda. 
To run the Javascript version, open JS/index.html within the
web browser of your choice.

Within the Javascript example use WASD to move the camera.
